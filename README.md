# Powerbi-Retail-Sales-Analysis

## Introduction

This Power BI project delivers a comprehensive retail sales report for Maven Market, focusing on key product performance metrics. It demonstrates end-to-end business intelligence capabilities, from data integration and robust data modeling to the creation of interactive dashboards providing actionable insights into sales, profit, transactions, and return rates.

## Data Source
In this project, I primarily utilized CSV files as input datasets. These included principal tables such as Customers, Products, and Transactions, along with lookup tables for Regions and Calendar (Date). These files were efficiently imported and transformed within Power BI's Power Query Editor.

While CSVs served as a practical and accessible format for this portfolio project, I am proficient in connecting Power BI to a wide array of enterprise-level data sources, including: 
- SQL Server Databases
- Cloud Services (e.g., Azure Blob Storage, Azure SQL Database, AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage): For highly scalable and flexible data lake solutions
